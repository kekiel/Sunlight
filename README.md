# Sunlight
The sunshine app from the Udacity Course "Developing Android Apps" - but added with L for Android Lollipop and Material Design.

Take a look at the original [Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853) (it´s free!).

[*Caution: Outdated project. My sunlight project has been discontinued. It refers to earlier versions of the v7 appcompat Library (21.0.3) and Android Studio (1.1).  I’ll keep the sources online for reference but with the current version of appcompat Library things may be different / easier today, so please refer to more up-to-date sources.]
